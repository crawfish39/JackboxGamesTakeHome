# JackboxGamesTakeHome
Interview challenge


## Overview
Many of our players like to create "tier lists" for their favorite games. As part of the streaming service, we thought it would be a neat idea to allow subscribers to organize titles into their own tiers.

Spend no more than two hours creating a grid with a max width of 5 columns and variable height. Rows should contain "love it", "like it", "leave it", "Haven't played".

Users should be able to organize 45 tiles (Jackbox Games titles) into the 5x4 grid defined above. We are looking for both completion and attention to detail. Feel free in-line comment anything you'd like us to know. The grid does not need to be responsive, so make sure to let us know (or hardcode) the appropriate viewport sizing.

This task should be done in some flavor of Javascript (vue preferred, but whatever you're most efficient with). You're welcome to use any resource or library available. The resulting code should be easily runnable via a docker container, a node command, or some other accessible self-contained process such as make.

## Instructions
Execute the following commands in your local terminal:
1. run 'git clone [https://github.com/crawfish39/JackboxGamesTakeHome.git](https://github.com/crawfish39/JackboxGamesTakeHome.git)' to clone this application on your local machine
2. run 'npm install' to install package dependencies.
3. run 'npm start' to start the application.
4. The app should open automatically in your browser but in case it doesn't, open 'localhost:3000' in your browser to view the application.
